A note-taker and distributor for stage managers.

* Notes can be assigned to specific people or groups of people.

  * A line note can be assigned to an actor. When the report is sent, you can set it so the actor only gets their own line notes.

  * A designer can get notes to them on the top of the design meeting report. Others are grouped by department below that.

* Notes are grouped by event - notes from one rehearsal, meeting, or performance are kept together.

* Events are grouped under productions. Multiple productions can be active at once.
